*(Geometry: two circles) Write a program that prompt the user to enter the center coordinate and radii of two circles
* and determines whether the second circle is inside the first or overlaps with the first.
* (Hint: Circle2 is inside Circle1 if the distance between the two centers <= r1 - r2 and overlap Circle1 if the
* distance between the two center <= r1 + r2. Test your program to cover all cases.)
* Here are the sample runs:
* Enter circle1's center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 0.5 5.1 13
* Enter circle2's center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 1 1.7 4.5
* circle2 is inside circle1
