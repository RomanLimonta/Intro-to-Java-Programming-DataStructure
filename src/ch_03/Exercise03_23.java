    * (Geometry: point in a rectangle?) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x,y) and checks whether
    * the point is within the rectangle centered at (0,0) with width 10 and height 5. For example (2,2) is inside the
    * rectangle and (6,4) is outside the rectangle, as shown in figure 3.7b (Hint: A point is in the rectangle if its
    * horizontal distance to (0,0) is less than or equal to 5.0/2. Test your program to cover all cases.
    *
    * Here are two samples
    * Enter a point with two coordinates: -4.9 2.49
    * Point (-4.9, 2.49) is in the rectangle
    *
    * Enter a point with two coordinates: -5.1 -2.4
    * Point (-5.1, -2.4) is in the rectangle  */
