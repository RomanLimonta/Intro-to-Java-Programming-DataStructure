/*
* (Geometry: two rectangles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center x-, y- coordinates, width, and
* height of two rectangles and determine whether the second rectangle is inside the first or overlaps with the first.
* Test your program to cover all cases.
*
* Here are the sample runs:
*
* Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 2.5 4 2.5 43
* Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1.5 5 0.5 3
* r2 is inside r1
*
* Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 5.5
* Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 3 4 4.5 5
* r2 overlaps r1
*
* Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 3
* Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 40 45 3 2
* r2 is inside r1
