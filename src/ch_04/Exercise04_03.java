/*
* (Geography: estimate areas) Use the GPS locations for Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; Savanah, Georgia: and
* Charlotte, North Carolina in the figure in Section 4.1 to compute the estimated area enclosed by these four cities.
* (Hint: Use the formula in Programming Exercise 4.2 to compute the distance between two cities. Divide the polygon
* int two triangles and use the formula in Programming Exercise 2.19 to compute the area of a triangle.)
*
* Atlanta = (33.7489954, -84.3879824)
* Orlando = (28.5383355, -81.3792365)
* Savannah =(32.0835407, -81.0998342)
* Charlotte = (35.2270869, -80.8431267)
